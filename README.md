# V8-Practice

This repository contains several simple C++ programs that use Google's V8 JavaScript Engine. These programs explore how to use V8 to execute JavaScript code in C++, how JavaScript functions can modify C++ variables by binding JavaScript functions to C++ functions, and how V8 can be integrated into C++ in a modular way.

## Examples
* [executeJavaScriptCode](http://github.com/yumarg/V8-Practice/tree/master/executeJavaScriptCode)
* [bindFunctions](http://github.com/yumarg/V8-Practice/tree/master/bindFunctions)
* [bindFunctionsModular](http://github.com/yumarg/V8-Practice/tree/master/bindFunctionsModular)

## Usage
To run an example, `cd` to the appropriate folder and enter `./runmain`.

## Notes
The version of V8 used for these examples is 4.8. The V8 binary files used for these examples are generating from building V8 on a Linux 64-bit machine. These examples have not been tested on other operating systems.
