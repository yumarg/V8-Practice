# V8-Practice

This repository contains several simple programs using Google's V8 JavaScript Engine. These programs explore how to use V8 to execute JavaScript code in C++, how JavaScript functions can modify C++ variables by binding JavaScript functions to C++ functions, and how V8 can be integrated into C++ in a modular way.

## Examples
* [executeJavaScriptCode](http://github.com/yumarg/V8-Practice/tree/master/executeJavaScriptCode)
* [bindFunctions](http://github.com/yumarg/V8-Practice/tree/master/bindFunctions)
* To be continued..

## Usage
After cloning the repo, you can try running each example via a simple `./runmain` within the folder of whichever example you wish to run.

## Notes
The version of V8 used for these examples is 4.8.
